## Description
(A summary of what you envision the project becoming. This does not have to be detailed or even a set in stone, but rather a snapshot of your current goals)

Contract Template Management Web App that allows users to generate and modify contracts by selecting appropriate terms and conditions to be used for the type of work being performed or respond to changes requested during negotiations.

## Use Case
(Who are the main users? What problems are they facing that you will solve? What will it do for users? What is the purpose/goal of the project?) 

Main users: 
Main users are Contract Specialists in larger companies, or administrative support staff in smaller companies. 
Problem: 
Contract templates can be a nightmare for editing. They are poorly formatted most of the time, and important updates can be missed because it can be difficult to identify if updating one term (contract provision) brings the need to update another term - missing this can lead to conflicting terms in the contract. 
Contract review guidelines documents offering alternative, previously approved language either do not exist, or are located in documents that are hard to locate in departmental shared files - as a result, these guidelines are rarely used leading to non-consistent review contract process. 
Solution:
Goal of this project is to offer users an app where they can easily select terms & conditions (contract provisions) that are best suited for the contract scope of work.
Terms and conditions are easily identified because they are provided in a list on main page 
Users with Administrator authorization can add standard language for each term and can create a list of alternative terms to be used for that term. 
Each contract term is editable. User can click on a term in a list to edit it. User can than choose from a list of alternative options for that term or can add completely new text to the term
After all individual terms are selected, terms list can be saved as a template for future use.
After all individual terms are selected, terms list can be extracted as a formatted Word document.

## Additional Information
(Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?)
I was really not excited about this project, but it was the only idea I had. Then I started drawing it on a board and all these ideas started coming to mind! I didn’t even list all of the stretch goals because they are emerging in my head as I type. 
I am keeping the MVP simple, but I am really hoping I will get to do a few of my stretch goals. Regarding the stretch goal of saving a list of terms as a template for a future use, I am worried that that can be beyond my capabilities at this time. Even with it being a stretch goal at this time, it is a very important feature to have in the app like this. Can I potentially save a list of items(terms) in Firestore for future use? I am torn between thinking “Yes, of course this can be done”, and thinking it is close to being impossible. I know I am overthinking a stretch goal so I wanted to ask what are your thoughts on saving a list of terms as a template for future use in Firebase?
