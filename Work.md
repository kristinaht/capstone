3. Research if I can have both Initial Values Master Terms List and     another List in Edit Term component with all alternative terms options to choose from. List in Edit Term component should allow users to select appropriate alternative term. 

4. Research options for having a list of alternative terms to choose from when updating an existing term. For now, it seems that using select tag in UpdateTermForm component is my best bet. Issue with that is that it means alternative terms will be hard coded in the select tag. Or will they???
